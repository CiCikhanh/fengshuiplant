# Tree Store Art — Starter Landing Page

This is a minimal starter landing page for a tree-themed art store. Replace images in the `images/` folder and update copy.

How to run locally
- Option A: Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Option B: Run a simple static server:
  - Using Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
  - Using Node: `npx serve .` (install serve if needed)
- Edit files in a code editor (VS Code recommended) and refresh.

Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push to your repo.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages → Source → choose branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and `/ (root)` then Save.
3. Wait a minute and your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` (or your custom domain).

Next steps / improvements
- Add a cart or link to Shopify/Etsy for selling.
- Integrate a form backend (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or build a serverless endpoint.
- Improve image optimization (serve WebP, thumbnails).
- Add analytics (GA4) and conversion tracking.
- Consider adding a modal lightbox for gallery images.

If you'd like, I can:
- Commit these files into your `CiCikhanh/fengshuiplant` repo.
- Replace placeholders with your images, copy, and social links.
- Add a GitHub Pages config and enable the site.
- Build a minimal shop (e.g., connect to Gumroad/Shopify) or add e-commerce buttons.
